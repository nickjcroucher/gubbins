This piece of software is not the version that was used in Croucher et. al. "Rapid Pneumococcal Evolution in Response to Clinical Interventions", Science 2011, 331 (6016): 430-434.
It is a work in progress and as such is not yet recommended for use by the community. We expect to make an official release of the software soon.
