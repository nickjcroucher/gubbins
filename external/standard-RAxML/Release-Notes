RAxML v7.5.4

We view RAxML code development as permanent work in progress.

As such, there are no fixed version available via github but only perpetual code modifications.

For reproducible science, we suggest that you actually include a copy of the actual RAxML source code you used 
in any data you make available or you intend to archive with the respective publication.
