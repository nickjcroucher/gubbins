# This setup script installs gubbins and dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64.
# In particular, we set things up in the users' home directory in ~/.local (as
# per the XDG spec).  We also add ~/.local/bin to PATH and ~/.local/lib to
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#
# If you'd prefer to install this system wide, have a look at the documentation
# at https://github.com/AidanDelaney/gubbins
#
# Contact Aidan Delaney <aidan@ontologyengineering.org> for issues with this
# script.
