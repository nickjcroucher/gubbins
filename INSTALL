== Prep work ==
As listed in the dependacies section below, you need
 * FastTree (>=2.1.4) http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/,
 * RAxML (>=7.2.8, the full version) http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html, and
 * Python 2.7.
Gubbins will build and install without FastTree and RAxML, but it won't work.

TODO:  Enure the Gubbins build process checks for FastTree and RAxML

Furthermore, we currently don't support RAxML build with PThreads.  You'll have
to use a more vanilla build such as using Makefile.SSE3.gcc or Makefile.gcc.

TODO: Ensure that Gubbins can deal with RAxML build for PThreads

Finally, the raxmlHPC binary should be named "raxmlHPC".

== Installing from a git checkout ==
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ su -
$ make
$ make install

Then install the Python scripts.
$ python setup.py install

== Installing from a released source tarball ==

$ tar xzvf gubbins-0.1.tar.gz
$ cd gubbins-0.1
$ ./configure
$ make
$ su -
$ make install
$ python setup.py install

The main executable should be in ./src/gubbins and in the system-wide directory
for locally compiled applications.  On Linux this is /usr/local/bin.

On Linux, you should ensure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH and that
/usr/local/lib (or /usr/local/lib64 on 64bit machines) are in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

== Installing into a specific user directory ==

It is common to want to build and install an application so that it is not
system-wide and is only available to your user.  On a Linux system this is
generally achieved by installing into the .local directory in your home
directory.

$ ./configure --prefix=~/.local
$ make
$ make install

On Linux, you should ensure that ~/.local/bin is in your $PATH and that
~/.local/lib (or ~/.local/lib64 on 64bit machines) are in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

If you are in the situation where your home directory is mounted over NFS (or
similar) and shared between multiple Linux distros (for example, 32bit Debian on
a cluster and 64bit Ubuntu on a desktop) then installing per-user in this manner
is probably not a good idea.

== Dependancies ==

These applications must be already installed in your PATH:
FastTree (>=2.1.4) http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/
RAxML (>=7.2.8, the full version) http://sco.h-its.org/exelixis/software.html
Python 2.7

These Python packages must be in your PYTHONPATH or will be automatically 
installed:
Biopython (>=1.59)
DendroPy  (>=3.11.1)
ReportLab (>= 2.5)

== Running the Python wrapper ==

There is a Pythong wrapper script that automates some of the preparatory work
that is necessary to run Gubbins.

To run the application:
run_gubbbins.py my_alignment.aln
